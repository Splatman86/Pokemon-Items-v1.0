# Pokemon-Items-v1.0
An overlay replacing certain textures with Pokemon held items!

# VERY IMPORTANT NOTE:
In the case of armor, these textures will NOT affect how they look when worn. Items like totems will look as changed, but armor pieces will show as vanilla textures. This only changes the item texture in the inventory GUI's. Effect icons are shown as intended.


# Item Changes:
- Totem of Undying changed to a Focus Sash Pokemon card
- Milk Bucket changed to Lum Berry
  ## Armor Changes:
  - Helmet: Safety Goggles
  - Chestplate: Malicious Armor
  - Leggings: Protective Pads
  - Boots: Heavy Duty Boots


# Effect Icon Changes:
- Strength: Choice Band
- Speed: Choice Scarf
- Fire Resistance: Rawst Berry
- Resistance: Assault Vest
- Instant Health: Sitrus Berry
- Regeneration: Leftovers
- Jump Boost: Air Balloon
- Slow Falling: Utility Umbrella
- Slowness: Lagging Tail
- Poison: Toxic Orb
- Wither: Black Sludge


# Known Issues / Glitches:
- Leather armor has its textures re-colored to have brown. I'll leave this unchanged for now, definitely something to note if you're using leather though
  - Leather goggles and boots have trouble rendering specific parts of the texture
- Items are shown to not be perfect in how they render, this is *likely* due to the dimensions of each image; theoretically![Uploading image.pngâ€¦]()
 fixable, I'll check when I have a chance to.

## I hope you enjoy using this texture pack. Might maintain it overtime, I'm not too sure. I made this in like an hour because I got bored one night.
